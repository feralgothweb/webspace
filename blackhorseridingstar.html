  <p>Kali Ecstatic Poetry</p>
  <p> <quote>The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight<br>
To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama’s feet,<br>
The blue flower of the feet of Kali, Siva’s Consort.<br>
Tasteless, to the bee, are the blossoms of desire.<br>
My Mother’s feet are black! This much of the mystery<br>
These mortal eyes behold, then hastily retreat.<br>
But Kamalakanta’s hopes are answered in the end;<br>
He swims in the Sea of Bliss, unmoved by joy or pain.<br></quote>

<p> <quote> This time I shall devour Thee utterly, Mother Kali!<br>

by Ramprasad (Ramprasad Sen)<br>
<br>

Original Language Bengali<br>
<br>
This time I shall devour Thee utterly, Mother Kali!<br>
For I was born under an evil star,<br>
And one so born becomes, they say, the eater of his mother.<br>
Thou must devour me first, or I myself shall eat Thee up;<br>
One or the other it must be.<br>
<br>
I shall besmear my hands with black<br>
and with black my face;<br>
With black I shall besmear the whole of my body.<br>
And when Death seizes me,<br>
with black I shall besmear his face.<br>
<br>
O Mother, I shall eat Thee up<br>
but not digest Thee;<br>
I shall install Thee in my heart<br>
And make Thee offerings with my mind.<br>
You may say that by eating Kali<br>
I shall embroil myself<br>
with Kala, Her Husband,<br>
but I am not afraid;<br>
Braving His anger,<br>
I shall chant my Mother's name.<br>
Come what may, I shall eat Thee up —<br>
Thee and Thy retinue —<br>
Or lose my life attempting it.<br></quote>

Kali, the wild dark Goddess<br>
Surging forth from the darkness<br>
You are that radiant blackness<br>
Exploding into form<br>
<br>
Kali, the wild dark Goddess<br>
The Primordial Shakti<br>
The grace of Your destruction<br>
The shadow of Your creativity<br>
<br>
Kali, the wild dark Goddess<br>
Dancing on Shiva's body<br>
You are the violence of the Big Bang<br>
Vibrating across time and space<br>
<br>
O Kali Ma<br>
Your mouth wide open<br>
A black hole<br>
Swallowing us all alive<br>
<br>
Your slightest whisper<br>
Sends cyclones screaming<br>
And tsunamis raging<br>
In mesmerizing horror<br>
<br>
Kali, the wild dark Goddess<br>
The tragedy of death<br>
The ferocity of birth<br>
The light and shadow of your play<br>
<br>
Kali, the wild dark Goddess<br>
A crack of thunder<br>
A flash of lighting<br>
Stuns the mind<br>
<br>
With your mischievous smile<br>
Lift this veil<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
Clouds part across the night sky<br>
<br>
Kali, the wild dark Goddess<br>
Your ecstatic dance<br>
Outrageous and sublime<br>
My knees tremble in terror<br>
<br>
Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
Your divine play<br>
Electrifying, terrifying<br>
Brings tears to my eyes<br>
<br>
Kali, the wild dark Goddess<br>
I have been searching for you everywhere<br>
But finally you showed me<br>
We have never been apart<br>
<br>
Kali, Kali, Kali<br>
One morning I awoke<br>
To the rapture of your presence<br>
To the ecstasy of our embrace<br>
<br>
O Kali Ma<br>
Your bittersweet bargain<br>
Of birth and death<br>
Of love and grief<br>
<br>
Churn up all of my fears<br>
Unmask my deepest desires<br>
I offer everything back<br>
Into your raging fire<br>
<br>
These flickering flames<br>
Reflecting like images in a mirror<br>
Illuminating your dark eyes<br>
Penetrating me deep inside<br>
<br>
Kali, the wild dark Goddess<br>
When at last I meet your gaze<br>
At the gates of death<br>
May the ferocity of your love<br>
Devour me.<br></quote></p>

<p><quote>The most exalted experience of bliss<br>
in any realm of being<br>
is directly knowing the universal Mother,<br>
the supremely blissful one.<br>
Ecstatic lovers of Kali the Sublime<br>
are not pilgrims to sacred shrines,<br>
for they hear all existence<br>
singing the glory of the Goddess.<br></quote>

O most Holy Heart of Jesus, fountain of every blessing,<br>
I adore Thee, I love Thee, and with a lively sorrow for my sins,<br>
I offer Thee this poor heart of mine.<br>
Make me humble, patient, pure and wholly obedient to Thy will.<br>
Grant, good Jesus, that I may live in Thee and for Thee.<br>
Protect me in the midst of danger;<br>
comfort me in my afflictions;<br>
give me health of body, assistance in my temporal needs,<br>
Thy blessing on all that I do, and the grace of a holy death.<br>
Within Thy Heart I place my every care.<br>
In every need let me come to Thee with humble trust saying,<br>
‘Heart of Jesus, help me.’<br>
Amen.<br>
</p>
<p><quote>Mother Kali, Mother Kali,<br>
Mother of the world-transforming<br>
and world-illumining<br>
Fiery Dance,<br>
O Mother, You are at once the destruction-flood<br>
Of Concern-Light and Compassion-Ocean<br>
For our heart’s aspiration-flame </quote> </p>
