    Introduction: An Overview of Death Traditions
  </h1>
  <p>Continuing the conversation from the <a href="gothcaveflowersb.html"> previous page</a>, 
    I elaborate on the discussions of the article: <a href="https://www.eterneva.com/resources/death-rituals">Death Rituals, 
      Ceremonies & Traditions</a></p>
  
  Some researchers suggest The Plague is where a decline in grief rituals in the West began.
<ul>
  <li> high death toll impeded normal grief rituals and last rites to be given for the dead</li> 
    <li> ignorance about the cause of death made people hesitant to touch bodies of deceased for fear of contracting the disease.</li>
  </ul>
<p>This was counter to the traditions at the time, in which families 
  <ul>
   <li>bathed the bodies at home after they passed, </li>
   <li>laid them out on the bed, </li>
   <li>invited folks over, </li>
   <li>held religious ceremonies, and </li>
   <li>planned the burial of their loved one with the local priest in the church’s cemetery.</li>
</ul>
  
  The Decameron is one record of life with The Plague, "its hundred stories, 
  shared in ten days by ten young people escaping the Plague 
  in mid-14th-century Florence, it combines sheer entertainment with a meaningful 
  humanistic message. A tribute to human ingenuity, an epic masterpiece of a rising, 
  dynamic mercantile society that pursues pleasure while being threatened by sudden extinction, 
  the Decameron can be read as a transgressive and escapist manual of behavior as well as a breviary 
  of moral predicaments intended for a secular, unprejudiced reader."

  <h3>The Victorian Era Made Grief & Death Fashionable</h3>
  “It was during this time that there was a flourishing of funeral-related businesses including 
  <ul>
    <li>coffin makers,</li>
    <li>embalmers, </li>
    <li>gravediggers</li>
  </ul>
   It was also during this time that burials 
  were moved to large parks in the country as 
  the cities no longer had room to continue burying the dead near their homes.”
