    Intro: Goth Flowers Cave
  </h1>
   <p>
There is  a new Creative Notion called Goth Flowers Cave. as far as I am thinking right now, it's a cave with goth themes flowers strewn like grass along the floor or as part of the floor, like an inner sanctum, and the upper atmosphere opens to the sun but has a covering of some sort for when it rains or snows.
