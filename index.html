    Intro: Why I Created Feral Goth
  </h1>
  <p>
    As a real goth, and an elder of the global goth community, I am learning that the Goth Culture's non-consumerist online presence needs to be revived. 
  </p>
    <p>
      <p><em>There is no standing tome to goth culture the way their used to be. </em> </p>
      <p>And as an elder in the community, I find it my obligation and duty to represent the culture and teach the next generations what goth culture really means at its core.
 </p>
    <h4> If you cannot face death, you are not really living your life. </h4> <p>So many people who are conditioned to think normally...do not allow themselves to challenge the way they think on automatic,<em> as if they are not really choosing anything. </em> As if all the information provided to them is not worthy of their critical thinking capabilities. </p> 
  <p>As a goth, it is my first responsibility to question everything, and make sure I'm not lying to myself, about anything. </p>
<p><strong>"Think for yourself. Question authority."</strong></p>
    <p>Often times, because this western society is living in a state of apocalypse, not lying to myself can mean that I am experiencing something like depression, because let's be real, shit in this life is fuckin sad. 
 </p>
<p>
On this website, you will find dry humor and sardonic commentary about living in modern Western culture, plus a good dose of things that bring me inspiration. All within a goth context, <p>as I will explain...</p>
    <p><em>The goth perspective: </em>
So many people are living a pathetic existence because they are lost in lies and living as zombies. </p> 
<p><em>That IS</em> fuckin sad.</p>
