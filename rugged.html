How to pray the <a href="https://www.catholicdoors.com/prayers/chaplets/chap21.htm">Chaplet </a> of Divine Mercy

Using the 59 beads Marian Rosary, begin with the:
Sign Of The Cross,

followed by 1 Our Father,

1 Hail Mary,

and the Apostles' Creed
   ( I believe in God the Father Almighty,
Creator of Heaven and earth,

and in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord,
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died, and was buried;
He descended into hell;
on the third day He rose again from the dead;
He ascended into Heaven
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the Holy Catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and the life everlasting.)

Amen.

Starting on the medal, say the following prayer:

"Eternal Father,
I offer You the Body and Blood,
Soul and Divinity of Your dearly Beloved Son,
Our Lord Jesus Christ,
in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world."

On each of the 10 beads that follow, say the following prayer:

"For the sake of His sorrowful Passion,
have mercy on us and on the whole world."

On each of the individual beads that separate the sets of 10 beads, repeat the prayer "Eternal Father... (above)." Then on each set of 10 beads, repeat the prayer "For the sake..." (above).

You then conclude with the following prayer 3 times:

"Holy God, Holy Mighty One,
Holy Immortal One,
have mercy on us
and on the whole world."

Optional Concluding Prayer:

"Eternal God,
in whom mercy is endless
and the treasury of compassion inexhaustible,
look kindly upon us
and increase Your mercy in us,
that in difficult moments
we might not despair nor become despondent,
but with great confidence
submit ourselves to Your holy will,
which is Love and Mercy itself."
