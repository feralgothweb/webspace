    Intro: Goth Flowers Cave
  </h1>
   <p class="p1">
There is  a new Creative Notion called Goth Flowers Cave. as far as I am thinking right now, it's a cave with goth themes flowers strewn like grass along the floor or as part of the floor, like an inner sanctum, and the upper atmosphere opens to the sun but has a covering of some sort for when it rains or snows.  
  </p>
  <p class="p2"> This is The Cure's album Bloodflowers. Its a great example of moopey goth music, reflective and morose, insightful from a forlorn heart touched place about life in general. </p>

    <p class="p3">Next on the list of Goth Flowers is a website about Death Rituals. Notably, our current western perspective on death comes largely from the Victrian era's cutural perspective on death. <a href="http://eterneva.com/resources/death-rituals">Death Rituals, Ceremonies & Traditions Around the World</a>
